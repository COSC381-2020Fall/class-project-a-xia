In today's video, we use our advanced pumps, drills, and apiaries to find some awesome resources like the slime rancher strange diamond!\n► Watch the entire Slime Rancher series - http://bit.ly/2vmK8No    ►Support Blitz on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/Blitzkriegsler\n\n- - - - -\n\nSlime Rancher Slime Science Update Information!\n\nNew Slime Rancher buildings:\n\n►The Lab\n\nThe Lab is a new ranch expansion, much like the Grotto and Overgrowth. It features some new, empty ranch patches for you to customize, but the main attraction lies in the old barn that Hobson once built sitting near the back. Within this barn you’ll find a strange array of scientific equipment that will allow you to harness the power of plorts and other resources to create gadgets.\n\nGadgets come in a variety of forms: everything from helpful utilities to decorative objects and more.\n\nBut before you build anything you’ll need the necessary ingredients. About half of the ingredients come in the form of plorts and the other half from resources previously undiscovered.\nimage\n\n►The Refinery\n\nThe Lab contains a large, silo-like device called the refinery. The refinery is a one-way storage unit for your plorts and resources you intend to use in Slime Science. No need to have the items in your vac tanks when fabricating gadgets, the refinery keeps it all neatly organized for you.\n\n\n►The Builder’s Shop\n\nThe builder’s shop is a special shop for budding Slime Scientists that allows them to purchase gadget blueprints. Once acquired, the specified gadgets can be fabricated so long as you have the necessary ingredients.\n\n\n►The Fabricator\n\nThe fabricator allows you to build any gadget so long as you have its blueprint. Once built, the gadget can be placed at any build site.\n\n\n►Build Sites\n\nOnce you built some gadgets you’ll want to place them. And using a special new upgrade to your vacpack, you’ll be able to see all the available build sites in the world. Then it’s just a matter of choosing which gadget goes where! Build sites are located all over the world, including your ranch.\n\n\n►Extractors\n\nIn addition to plorts, all gadgets will require new, unique resources. These resources can be acquired in a variety of ways, but the most dependable method is to use a series of gadgets known as extractors.\n\nExtractors include drills, pumps, and apiaries and can be placed at any build site. Over time they collect resources and must be emptied periodically. Drills will unearth gems and minerals, pumps will siphon up oils and other fluids, and apiaries will harvest honey and other bee products.\nimage\n\n- - - - -\n\nSlime Rancher Gameplay Information:\n\nSlime Rancher is the tale of Beatrix LeBeau, a plucky, young rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the 'Far, Far Range' where she tries her hand at making a living wrangling slimes. With a can-do attitude, plenty of grit, and her trusty vacpack, Beatrix attempts to stake a claim, amass a fortune, and avoid the continual peril that looms from the rolling, jiggling avalanche of slimes around every corner. Each day will present new challenges to players as they attempt to amass a great fortune in the business of slime ranching. \n\n- - - - -\n\nSlime Rancher Gameplay Features:\n\n►Vacuum things up and shoot them out: gameplay driven by two simple actions\n\n►Manage a bustling eco-system of slimes who have wants, needs, and emotions that drive their behavior\n\n►Customize your ranch however you choose with slimes, corrals, gardens, silos, and more\n\n►Grow crops and raise chickens back on the ranch or forage in the wilds of the Far, Far Range\n\n►Use slime science to combine and create new slime species\n\n►Embrace total freedom to choose where to explore, which slimes to ranch, and how you'll stake your claim\n\n- - - - - \n\nFor more information on Slime Rancher, visit these links:\n\nSlime Rancher Official Website - http://www.slimerancher.com/\nOfficial Slime Rancher Trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAfP-JCjrmc\n\nSlime Rancher on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/433340/\n\n- - - - -\n\nSlime Rancher is developed by Monomi Park, who were kind enough to share a key with me.",
