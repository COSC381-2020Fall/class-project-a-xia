For comparison, last year's event raised just under $500,000. \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFollow SDA on Twitter https://twitter.com/SDAspeedruns \nYoutube playlist for AGDQ 2014 http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMNeTFVQZEQNOKx55mGOeTWdGSg0ywDHw\nSee SDA on Twitch http://www.twitch.tv/speeddemosarchivesda\n\nSee all runs from SGDQ 2013 http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMNeTFVQZEQOk-fVeyPAd2kyqQDjhYm8w&feature=mh_lolz\nGet a text message every time a video is uploaded http://motube.us/SpeedDemosArchiveSDA\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDownload AGDQ 2014 https://archive.org/details/AwesomeGamesDoneQuick2014\n\nDownload SGDQ 2013 http://archive.org/details/SummerGamesDoneQuick2013\nSGDQ 2013 Highlight reel http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGcp6l67qiU&feature=youtu.be\nSGDQ 2013 Blooper Reel http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFFnk045iO8&feature=youtu.be\n\nUraniumAnchor's channel (guy who made the highlight/blooper reels for AGDQ/SGDQ 2013).
