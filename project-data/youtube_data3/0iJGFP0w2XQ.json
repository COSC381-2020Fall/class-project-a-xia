It is a surreal mix of gameplay and visual puzzles, with calming music throughout the weirdness of the areas.\n\nUnlike some games, Antichamber isn't afraid to make you explore, and backtrack a lot. Backtracking in antichamber changes the layout of locations, or even leads back to entirely different rooms.\n\nAntichamber isn't for everyone, but it is safe to say that if you are a fan of Valve's portal series, you are likely to find a great game here. The game features in-game narration through 'screens' in the game, which serve as both guide, hints and narration of sorts. The goal is fairly simple, to make progression through the game in a decent time - and more to the point, to solve the various puzzles.\n\nAntiChamber's visuals are impressive, with a heavy emphasis on angle of view and with excellent animations - for example, on platforms that only appear when you walk on them, and then drop away the moment you jump. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed my time with the title, and would highly encourage others to check the game out!",
