The current world record for the 100% category is under 20 minutes: https://www.speedrun.com/Antichamber#100\n\nI didn't get all the purple cubes. This is only my fifth time playing the game and my third attempt at a speedrun. This is definitely not the best and there are a lot of mistakes, but I'm very happy that I was able to get below 1 hour. The video is unedited; FRAPS recorded to an AVI at 40fps and then I used VLC to convert it to MP4 for compression, then I uploaded it straight to YouTube. This is not 'official' by any means. I did make use of glitches in this version of the game.\n\nThis video is also on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/lb___/v/96401564",
