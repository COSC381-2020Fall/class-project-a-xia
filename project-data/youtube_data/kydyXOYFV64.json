Did anyone catch the stream yesterday!?!?!\n\nI got to play Among Us with such a wild crew I actually am still recovering LOL. If you want to watch the vod, the crew was Pewdiepie, MoistCritikal, Summit1g, dakotaz, Logic, xQc, adept., Trainwrecktv, and Lirik! NOT ASMR lmao - https://www.twitch.tv/videos/751722045\n\nSo this all coincided SUPER well, I was already planning on making an Among Us video after our ASMR stream (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/742050877) and here we are! I hope you enjoy! You'll probably pick it up pretty quick, but you are the secret second impostor GAINING MY TRUST while I do tasks! Good luck.....\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH to my lovely friends who voiced in this!!!
