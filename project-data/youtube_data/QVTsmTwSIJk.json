The game takes place in a space-themed setting where players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors. The goal for the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map, and the Impostors' goal is to kill the Crewmates without being identified. While initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received an influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it.\n\n** GAME INFO **\nName: Among Us\nDeveloper: InnerSloth\nPublisher: InnerSloth\nPlatform: Android, iOS, Microsoft Windows\nRelease: June 15, 2018\nGenre: Party, Social Deduction\nMode(s): Multiplayer\n__________\n\n** FRIENDS **\nAPL: @aplfisher \nChilled: @ChilledChaosGAME \nDiction: @Diction \nGassy: @GassyMexican \nJoe Biden: @Hutch \nnfen: @NFEN \nRavage: @TheSandyRavage \nSarkypoo: @Mr Sark \nSham: @AllShamNoWow \n__________\n\n** ABOUT ME ** \nHello everyone!
