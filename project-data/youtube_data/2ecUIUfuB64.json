            "description": "I want to address some things about this video:\n-The song choice. \nI know that the song is about gender roles, stereotypes and I am very well aware about it. I personally love the song and the message it conveyed. I tend to change or twist the idea of the song / lyrics, so it would go with my ideas / animation. (In this case, some parts of the song didn’t really go along, but I had to somehow go around some lyrics)\n\n-Why there isn’t much to it?\nSFM is a super limited program. So I cannot do crazy stuff just like in Blender (or any other program) and I do not have props / maps for this game. So I have to scavenge or think how certain things could’ve worked out.\n\n-Why it’s in 3d?\nI specialize in it. (I know it is not a super puper dupper stunning visual animation, but I tried)\n\n-Why the video is dark themed? / Why there is no good ending?\nIf you will watch my past animations, they are mostly dark themed. Idk, there are lots of funny videos of Among Us. My humor can be garbage or “more boomer” like, so I am just going to make something what I can do. I’m not inventing bike a new ‘xD\n\n-Will there be more Among Us animations?\nI might think of something. As “FNAF Security Breach” was announced, I want to make a test video (some short video) and then maybe I can do something about Among Us? I personally loved to animate something else than FNAF and BATIM, plus, it was easy to animate these little creatures. In short - Stay on alert of straw polls / updates on my YT community page.\n\n-Some parts of the animation doesn’t make sense / doesn’t go with the games logic.\nI know, my fault. Didn’t thought it through as it was meant to be a silly project and I didn’t want to go back and rethink it again ^^”\n\n-NO MORE FNAF!?!\nI-   My whole channel is about it .-. Of course there will be more content about it. It tends to be repetitive when you make 55+ animation, which are 2-5 min long. (I have planned +20 projects, + 1 reboot of one series, + 30 other songs, which needs to be still planned) I still have so much to do… yikes. I get that most of my subscribers are here for FNAF and I do not mind making animations about, but a slight switch is sooo refreshing. For example, eating the same bread for a yearlong will not make it taste better. You get bored of it.\n\n-Thank you ❤︎\nThank you for letting me do something besides FNAF and BATIM. It is motivating when people watch my stuff. I’ve been overwhelmed from the support you all brought upon me, but it also brought my motivation for animations. So really, thank you all for being awesome!!\n\n-How can we support you?\nIt’s not obligated to do, but I would really appreciate if you would follow my social media and just simply watch my stuff on YouTube (Ofc, check out the music creators! Their music inspire me to make animations / stories ❤︎) If you really, reaaaally want to support me materially, then I have a channels membership option. Starting from Golden Tier, you can access my discord server ^^”\n\nForgot to say!!!
