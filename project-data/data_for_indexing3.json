Kindly avoid posting spoilers in the comments or solutions to puzzles either in this video or future ones so as not to spoil the experience for me or those that haven\u2019t seen the game before.\n\nSome people watch the videos for this game and lament that I don\u2019t cut out or accelerate the time spent figuring out and solving the puzzles. For me, the joy of puzzle solving is the process itself, working out what the game wants from you and then making it happen with the tools you have available. For games such as this, the journey is far more important than the destination and if you focus only on reaching the end goal, you\u2019ll miss all the amazing experiences along the way. Additionally, cutting out or condensing the puzzling pondering part of the game will prevent me from showing what the game is actually like, something I consider very important with my content.\n\nThat aside, we\u2019ve finally gotten past the seemingly impossible puzzle which has brought us to another place with more puzzles yet. Slowly we\u2019re whittling down the avenues we can progress down, for some require a tool that we don\u2019t yet possess: the red thingy. Whatever power it possesses must be fantastic indeed which makes me hope that I\u2019ll get hold of it soon.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Kikoskia\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/kikoskia\nDiscord: https://discordapp.com/invite/X2YUmPh", "topic": "Antichamber"}, {"id": "V9HvgmNVQGM", "title": "Antichamber - Gameplay Only, No Commentary HD - Part One", "description": "Footage from the first ten minutes or so of Antichamber, a new and brilliantly surreal indie game available now on Steam and created by Alexander Bruce.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/219890\nhttp://antichamber-game.com\n\nSubscribe if you would like to see more!", "topic": "Antichamber"}, {"id": "Fg1oYxclqV8", "title": "Antichamber Yellow Gun walkthrough", "description": "In Antichamber, you can get something for nothing!", "topic": "Antichamber"}, {"id": "nxaCCDiIHwA", "title": "Antichamber: All Secret Cubes [Walkthrough.]", "description": "This is a quick guide explaining how to reach all 13 obtainable cubes as of the first release version of Antichamber.", "topic": "Antichamber"}, {"id": "h-Ov3CWED14", "title": "Antichamber Ep. 1", "description": "Welcome to my playthrough (with commentary) of Antichamber, a nearly impossible to describe psychological puzzle game.

It is a surreal mix of gameplay and visual puzzles, with calming music throughout the weirdness of the areas.\n\nUnlike some games, Antichamber isn't afraid to make you explore, and backtrack a lot. Backtracking in antichamber changes the layout of locations, or even leads back to entirely different rooms.\n\nAntichamber isn't for everyone, but it is safe to say that if you are a fan of Valve's portal series, you are likely to find a great game here. The game features in-game narration through 'screens' in the game, which serve as both guide, hints and narration of sorts. The goal is fairly simple, to make progression through the game in a decent time - and more to the point, to solve the various puzzles.\n\nAntiChamber's visuals are impressive, with a heavy emphasis on angle of view and with excellent animations - for example, on platforms that only appear when you walk on them, and then drop away the moment you jump. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed my time with the title, and would highly encourage others to check the game out!", "topic": "Antichamber"}, {"id": "sZ0yxXxwg_k", "title": "Minecraft - Antichamber", "description": "Degno di the code... anche se mooolto pi\u00f9 breve\n\nSito Ufficiale: www.lolclub.it\nPagina Facebook: www.facebook.com/molpad\nPagina Google+: plus.google.com/+LolclubIt", "topic": "Antichamber"}, {"id": "Rx_gBV0KIkg", "title": "Let's Play Antichamber Part 4 - The Ground Floor (Patreon Chosen Game)", "description": "Watch more Antichamber! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5dr1EHvfwpO0Vnhkm5u2vNGuMsuQaDSr\n\nSupport what I do by subscribing on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/SebastianSB\n\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/SebastianSB\n\nTwitch (streaming): http://www.twitch.tv/sebastiansb\n\nBuy Antichamber on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/\n\nGame Description:\n\nAntichamber is a mind-bending psychological exploration game where nothing can be taken for granted.
