It features some new, empty ranch patches for you to customize, but the main attraction lies in the old barn that Hobson once built sitting near the back. Within this barn you\u2019ll find a strange array of scientific equipment that will allow you to harness the power of plorts and other resources to create gadgets.\n\nGadgets come in a variety of forms: everything from helpful utilities to decorative objects and more.\n\nBut before you build anything you\u2019ll need the necessary ingredients. About half of the ingredients come in the form of plorts and the other half from resources previously undiscovered.\nimage\n\n\u25baThe Refinery\n\nThe Lab contains a large, silo-like device called the refinery. The refinery is a one-way storage unit for your plorts and resources you intend to use in Slime Science. No need to have the items in your vac tanks when fabricating gadgets, the refinery keeps it all neatly organized for you.\n\n\n\u25baThe Builder\u2019s Shop\n\nThe builder\u2019s shop is a special shop for budding Slime Scientists that allows them to purchase gadget blueprints. Once acquired, the specified gadgets can be fabricated so long as you have the necessary ingredients.\n\n\n\u25baThe Fabricator\n\nThe fabricator allows you to build any gadget so long as you have its blueprint. Once built, the gadget can be placed at any build site.\n\n\n\u25baBuild Sites\n\nOnce you built some gadgets you\u2019ll want to place them. And using a special new upgrade to your vacpack, you\u2019ll be able to see all the available build sites in the world. Then it\u2019s just a matter of choosing which gadget goes where! Build sites are located all over the world, including your ranch.\n\n\n\u25baExtractors\n\nIn addition to plorts, all gadgets will require new, unique resources. These resources can be acquired in a variety of ways, but the most dependable method is to use a series of gadgets known as extractors.\n\nExtractors include drills, pumps, and apiaries and can be placed at any build site. Over time they collect resources and must be emptied periodically. Drills will unearth gems and minerals, pumps will siphon up oils and other fluids, and apiaries will harvest honey and other bee products.\nimage\n\n- - - - -\n\nSlime Rancher Gameplay Information:\n\nSlime Rancher is the tale of Beatrix LeBeau, a plucky, young rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the 'Far, Far Range' where she tries her hand at making a living wrangling slimes. With a can-do attitude, plenty of grit, and her trusty vacpack, Beatrix attempts to stake a claim, amass a fortune, and avoid the continual peril that looms from the rolling, jiggling avalanche of slimes around every corner.

A slime is a kind of space hopper that eats and poops. Subscribe for more Xbox One gameplay on Outside Xbox? http://www.tinyurl.com/SubToOxbox\n\nYour primary farming implement in Slime Rancher is your Vacpack: a farming gun that sucks up slimes, slime food and slime by-products (plorts), then shoots those same items wherever you aim them. \n\nYour slime rancher farming business is based on selling these plorts for cash. Who is buying plorts? Why are they buying them? Do we want to even know?

It features some new, empty ranch patches for you to customize, but the main attraction lies in the old barn that Hobson once built sitting near the back. Within this barn you\u2019ll find a strange array of scientific equipment that will allow you to harness the power of plorts and other resources to create gadgets.\n\nGadgets come in a variety of forms: everything from helpful utilities to decorative objects and more.\n\nBut before you build anything you\u2019ll need the necessary ingredients. About half of the ingredients come in the form of plorts and the other half from resources previously undiscovered.\nimage\n\n\u25baThe Refinery\n\nThe Lab contains a large, silo-like device called the refinery. The refinery is a one-way storage unit for your plorts and resources you intend to use in Slime Science. No need to have the items in your vac tanks when fabricating gadgets, the refinery keeps it all neatly organized for you.\n\n\n\u25baThe Builder\u2019s Shop\n\nThe builder\u2019s shop is a special shop for budding Slime Scientists that allows them to purchase gadget blueprints. Once acquired, the specified gadgets can be fabricated so long as you have the necessary ingredients.\n\n\n\u25baThe Fabricator\n\nThe fabricator allows you to build any gadget so long as you have its blueprint. Once built, the gadget can be placed at any build site.\n\n\n\u25baBuild Sites\n\nOnce you built some gadgets you\u2019ll want to place them. And using a special new upgrade to your vacpack, you\u2019ll be able to see all the available build sites in the world. Then it\u2019s just a matter of choosing which gadget goes where! Build sites are located all over the world, including your ranch.\n\n\n\u25baExtractors\n\nIn addition to plorts, all gadgets will require new, unique resources. These resources can be acquired in a variety of ways, but the most dependable method is to use a series of gadgets known as extractors.\n\nExtractors include drills, pumps, and apiaries and can be placed at any build site. Over time they collect resources and must be emptied periodically. Drills will unearth gems and minerals, pumps will siphon up oils and other fluids, and apiaries will harvest honey and other bee products.\nimage\n\n- - - - -\n\nSlime Rancher Gameplay Information:\n\nSlime Rancher is the tale of Beatrix LeBeau, a plucky, young rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the 'Far, Far Range' where she tries her hand at making a living wrangling slimes.

It features some new, empty ranch patches for you to customize, but the main attraction lies in the old barn that Hobson once built sitting near the back. Within this barn you\u2019ll find a strange array of scientific equipment that will allow you to harness the power of plorts and other resources to create gadgets.\n\nGadgets come in a variety of forms: everything from helpful utilities to decorative objects and more.\n\nBut before you build anything you\u2019ll need the necessary ingredients. About half of the ingredients come in the form of plorts and the other half from resources previously undiscovered.\nimage\n\n\u25baThe Refinery\n\nThe Lab contains a large, silo-like device called the refinery. The refinery is a one-way storage unit for your plorts and resources you intend to use in Slime Science. No need to have the items in your vac tanks when fabricating gadgets, the refinery keeps it all neatly organized for you.\n\n\n\u25baThe Builder\u2019s Shop\n\nThe builder\u2019s shop is a special shop for budding Slime Scientists that allows them to purchase gadget blueprints. Once acquired, the specified gadgets can be fabricated so long as you have the necessary ingredients.\n\n\n\u25baThe Fabricator\n\nThe fabricator allows you to build any gadget so long as you have its blueprint. Once built, the gadget can be placed at any build site.\n\n\n\u25baBuild Sites\n\nOnce you built some gadgets you\u2019ll want to place them. And using a special new upgrade to your vacpack, you\u2019ll be able to see all the available build sites in the world. Then it\u2019s just a matter of choosing which gadget goes where! Build sites are located all over the world, including your ranch.\n\n\n\u25baExtractors\n\nIn addition to plorts, all gadgets will require new, unique resources. These resources can be acquired in a variety of ways, but the most dependable method is to use a series of gadgets known as extractors.\n\nExtractors include drills, pumps, and apiaries and can be placed at any build site. Over time they collect resources and must be emptied periodically. Drills will unearth gems and minerals, pumps will siphon up oils and other fluids, and apiaries will harvest honey and other bee products.\nimage\n\n- - - - -\n\nSlime Rancher Gameplay Information:\n\nSlime Rancher is the tale of Beatrix LeBeau, a plucky, young rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the 'Far, Far Range' where she tries her hand at making a living wrangling slimes.

It features some new, empty ranch patches for you to customize, but the main attraction lies in the old barn that Hobson once built sitting near the back. Within this barn you\u2019ll find a strange array of scientific equipment that will allow you to harness the power of plorts and other resources to create gadgets.\n\nGadgets come in a variety of forms: everything from helpful utilities to decorative objects and more.\n\nBut before you build anything you\u2019ll need the necessary ingredients. About half of the ingredients come in the form of plorts and the other half from resources previously undiscovered.\nimage\n\n\u25baThe Refinery\n\nThe Lab contains a large, silo-like device called the refinery. The refinery is a one-way storage unit for your plorts and resources you intend to use in Slime Science. No need to have the items in your vac tanks when fabricating gadgets, the refinery keeps it all neatly organized for you.\n\n\n\u25baThe Builder\u2019s Shop\n\nThe builder\u2019s shop is a special shop for budding Slime Scientists that allows them to purchase gadget blueprints. Once acquired, the specified gadgets can be fabricated so long as you have the necessary ingredients.\n\n\n\u25baThe Fabricator\n\nThe fabricator allows you to build any gadget so long as you have its blueprint. Once built, the gadget can be placed at any build site.\n\n\n\u25baBuild Sites\n\nOnce you built some gadgets you\u2019ll want to place them. And using a special new upgrade to your vacpack, you\u2019ll be able to see all the available build sites in the world. Then it\u2019s just a matter of choosing which gadget goes where! Build sites are located all over the world, including your ranch.\n\n\n\u25baExtractors\n\nIn addition to plorts, all gadgets will require new, unique resources. These resources can be acquired in a variety of ways, but the most dependable method is to use a series of gadgets known as extractors.\n\nExtractors include drills, pumps, and apiaries and can be placed at any build site. Over time they collect resources and must be emptied periodically. Drills will unearth gems and minerals, pumps will siphon up oils and other fluids, and apiaries will harvest honey and other bee products.\nimage\n\n- - - - -\n\nSlime Rancher Gameplay Information:\n\nSlime Rancher is the tale of Beatrix LeBeau, a plucky, young rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the 'Far, Far Range' where she tries her hand at making a living wrangling slimes.

It features some new, empty ranch patches for you to customize, but the main attraction lies in the old barn that Hobson once built sitting near the back. Within this barn you\u2019ll find a strange array of scientific equipment that will allow you to harness the power of plorts and other resources to create gadgets.\n\nGadgets come in a variety of forms: everything from helpful utilities to decorative objects and more.\n\nBut before you build anything you\u2019ll need the necessary ingredients. About half of the ingredients come in the form of plorts and the other half from resources previously undiscovered.\nimage\n\n\u25baThe Refinery\n\nThe Lab contains a large, silo-like device called the refinery. The refinery is a one-way storage unit for your plorts and resources you intend to use in Slime Science. No need to have the items in your vac tanks when fabricating gadgets, the refinery keeps it all neatly organized for you.\n\n\n\u25baThe Builder\u2019s Shop\n\nThe builder\u2019s shop is a special shop for budding Slime Scientists that allows them to purchase gadget blueprints. Once acquired, the specified gadgets can be fabricated so long as you have the necessary ingredients.\n\n\n\u25baThe Fabricator\n\nThe fabricator allows you to build any gadget so long as you have its blueprint. Once built, the gadget can be placed at any build site.\n\n\n\u25baBuild Sites\n\nOnce you built some gadgets you\u2019ll want to place them. And using a special new upgrade to your vacpack, you\u2019ll be able to see all the available build sites in the world. Then it\u2019s just a matter of choosing which gadget goes where! Build sites are located all over the world, including your ranch.\n\n\n\u25baExtractors\n\nIn addition to plorts, all gadgets will require new, unique resources. These resources can be acquired in a variety of ways, but the most dependable method is to use a series of gadgets known as extractors.\n\nExtractors include drills, pumps, and apiaries and can be placed at any build site. Over time they collect resources and must be emptied periodically. Drills will unearth gems and minerals, pumps will siphon up oils and other fluids, and apiaries will harvest honey and other bee products.\nimage\n\n- - - - -\n\nSlime Rancher Gameplay Information:\n\nSlime Rancher is the tale of Beatrix LeBeau, a plucky, young rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the 'Far, Far Range' where she tries her hand at making a living wrangling slimes.
