The game takes place in a space-themed setting where players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors. The goal for the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map, and the Impostors' goal is to kill the Crewmates without being identified. While initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received an influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it.\n\n** GAME INFO **\nName: Among Us\nDeveloper: InnerSloth\nPublisher: InnerSloth\nPlatform: Android, iOS, Microsoft Windows\nRelease: June 15, 2018\nGenre: Party, Social Deduction\nMode(s): Multiplayer\n__________\n\n** FRIENDS **\nAPL: @aplfisher \nChilled: @ChilledChaosGAME \nDiction: @Diction \nGassy: @GassyMexican \nJoe Biden: @Hutch \nnfen: @NFEN \nRavage: @TheSandyRavage \nSarkypoo: @Mr Sark \nSham: @AllShamNoWow \n__________\n\n** ABOUT ME ** \nHello everyone!

I personally love the song and the message it conveyed. I tend to change or twist the idea of the song / lyrics, so it would go with my ideas / animation. (In this case, some parts of the song didn\u2019t really go along, but I had to somehow go around some lyrics)\n\n-Why there isn\u2019t much to it?\nSFM is a super limited program. So I cannot do crazy stuff just like in Blender (or any other program) and I do not have props / maps for this game. So I have to scavenge or think how certain things could\u2019ve worked out.\n\n-Why it\u2019s in 3d?\nI specialize in it. (I know it is not a super puper dupper stunning visual animation, but I tried)\n\n-Why the video is dark themed? / Why there is no good ending?\nIf you will watch my past animations, they are mostly dark themed. Idk, there are lots of funny videos of Among Us. My humor can be garbage or \u201cmore boomer\u201d like, so I am just going to make something what I can do. I\u2019m not inventing bike a new \u2018xD\n\n-Will there be more Among Us animations?\nI might think of something. As \u201cFNAF Security Breach\u201d was announced, I want to make a test video (some short video) and then maybe I can do something about Among Us? I personally loved to animate something else than FNAF and BATIM, plus, it was easy to animate these little creatures. In short - Stay on alert of straw polls / updates on my YT community page.\n\n-Some parts of the animation doesn\u2019t make sense / doesn\u2019t go with the games logic.\nI know, my fault. Didn\u2019t thought it through as it was meant to be a silly project and I didn\u2019t want to go back and rethink it again ^^\u201d\n\n-NO MORE FNAF!?!\nI-   My whole channel is about it .-. Of course there will be more content about it. It tends to be repetitive when you make 55+ animation, which are 2-5 min long. (I have planned +20 projects, + 1 reboot of one series, + 30 other songs, which needs to be still planned) I still have so much to do\u2026 yikes. I get that most of my subscribers are here for FNAF and I do not mind making animations about, but a slight switch is sooo refreshing. For example, eating the same bread for a yearlong will not make it taste better. You get bored of it.\n\n-Thank you \u2764\ufe0e\nThank you for letting me do something besides FNAF and BATIM. It is motivating when people watch my stuff. I\u2019ve been overwhelmed from the support you all brought upon me, but it also brought my motivation for animations. So really, thank you all for being awesome!!\n\n-How can we support you?\nIt\u2019s not obligated to do, but I would really appreciate if you would follow my social media and just simply watch my stuff on YouTube (Ofc, check out the music creators! Their music inspire me to make animations / stories \u2764\ufe0e) If you really, reaaaally want to support me materially, then I have a channels membership option.
